Natural Language Processing of YouTube descriptions

This project explores data scraped from YouTube, inorder to understand underlying themes of two 
youtube channels. We perform statistical analysis on integer variables such as like count and comments count. As well as natural language processing of the text variables title and description. We use the quanteda package for text processing and the STM package for topic modeling.
